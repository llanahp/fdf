# fdf

FdF is a project of school 42. The goal of the project is to create a program that can read a text file with a 3D terrain representation and generate a graphical representation of it in a window. The project teaches the basics of graphics programming, including creating a window, handling keyboard and mouse events, and image manipulation.

## How to start this proyect

For my personal experience, the following list is the order that I would recomment to achive this proyect:
 * Read the map and store it
 * Create a window and learn how to draw a point
 * Learn to draw a line
 * learn how to convert from Cartesian to isometric coordinates
 * learn how to make a gradient
